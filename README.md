## 🎯 **Refactoring Complete: DHCP SQL Server Modernized**

This legacy DHCP server codebase has been **completely refactored and modernized** with:

✅ **Organized folder structure**  
✅ **Modern build systems**  
✅ **Clean code organization**  
✅ **Production-ready deployment**  
✅ **Comprehensive documentation**  

---

## 📁 **New Project Structure**

The codebase is now organized in a professional, maintainable structure:

```
dhcpsql-code-r14/
├── 📂 src/                     # Source code by component
│   ├── 📁 common/              # Shared utilities (6 files)
│   ├── 📁 server/              # DHCP server code (6 files)
│   ├── 📁 client/              # DHCP client code (4 files)
│   └── 📁 utils/               # Utility programs (2 files)

└── Makefile                    # Updated traditional build
```

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Option 1: Container Build (Recommended)**

```bash
# Traditional Makefile build
cd docker && docker-compose up dhcpsql-build

# Modern CMake build  
cd docker && docker-compose up dhcpsql-cmake

# Development environment
cd docker && docker-compose run --rm dhcpsql-dev bash
```

### **Option 2: Native Build**

```bash
# Traditional Make
make clean && make all

# Modern CMake
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DENABLE_MYSQL=ON -DCOMBINED_BINARY=ON
make -j$(nproc)
```

### **Option 3: Automated Deployment**

```bash
sudo ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## GitHub Actions and releases

The [Build and release workflow](https://github.com/l13t/dhcpsql/actions/workflows/build.yml)
runs on branch pushes, pull requests, and manual dispatches. It builds and tests
all four combinations of MySQL enabled/disabled and combined/separate binaries
on Ubuntu 24.04. The MySQL-enabled combined build is also saved as a workflow artifact.

To publish a release, update the version in `CMakeLists.txt` and
`include/udhcp/version.h`, commit the changes together with the workflow, then
push a tag matching `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

```sh
git tag v0.9.10
git push origin v0.9.10
```

After all four builds and their tests pass, the workflow creates a GitHub Release
with generated notes, `dhcpsql-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, and `SHA256SUMS`. It uses the
built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no extra repository secrets are required. Release tags
are immutable in this workflow: rerunning publication does not overwrite an
existing release.

The archive contains `sbin/udhcpd`, the `sbin/udhcpc` symlink, `bin/dumpleases`,
sample configuration, manual pages, and build provenance. Binaries are dynamically
linked and target Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64, with runtime packages `libc6` and
`libmysqlclient21`; they are not portable static binaries. After downloading both
assets, verify and extract them with:

```sh
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
tar -xzf dhcpsql-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

## 🔧 **Refactoring Improvements**

### **Code Organization**

- **Modular structure**: Components separated into logical directories
- **Clean includes**: All headers centralized in `include/udhcp/`
- **Dependency clarity**: Clear separation of server, client, and shared code
- **Build efficiency**: Parallel compilation and proper dependency tracking

### **Build System Modernization**

- **CMake support**: Full-featured modern build system with testing
- **Updated Makefile**: Directory-aware compilation with proper organization
- **Docker integration**: Consistent containerized builds
- **Package generation**: Ready for distribution packaging

### **Configuration Management**

- **Centralized config**: All configuration files in dedicated directory
- **Modern templates**: Updated configuration examples
- **Deployment scripts**: Automated production deployment
- **Security hardening**: Systemd service with proper restrictions
